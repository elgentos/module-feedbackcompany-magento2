## Developed for The Feedback Company

The Feedback Company is well on its way to become one of the leading - independent - online feedback specialists in Europe.

Reviews will be crucial in future marketing campaigns for organizations. Shopping behavior has changed drastically and organizations have to win the client at ZMOT (zero moment of truth).

Because of these changes and the benefits of reviews for Adwords, Google has given reviews an increasingly important role in recent years. Consumers who determine their choice by searching through Google - and use the help of reviews - will find these reviews automatically in the organic results, Google product search and Google Adwords.
